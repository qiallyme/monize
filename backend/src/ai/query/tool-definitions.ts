      "Render a chart in the chat so the user can see the data visually. Call this AFTER gathering numbers with another tool (query_transactions, get_spending_by_category, get_net_worth_history, compare_periods, etc.). Choose the chart type that fits the data: 'pie' for category breakdowns with 6 or fewer slices, 'bar' for larger breakdowns or period comparisons, 'line' or 'area' for time series (months or weeks). Pass a compact subset of the data (at most 10-15 data points) and aggregate the long tail into an 'Other' bucket. Values must be positive numbers (use absolute values for expenses). Do not narrate the chart's existence in your reply; just render it and summarize the findings.",
