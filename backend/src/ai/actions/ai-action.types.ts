/**
 * Types for the AI Assistant human-in-the-loop write actions.
 *
 * When the assistant proposes a write (create a transaction, categorize a
 * transaction, create a payee) the executor runs a dry-run preview and produces
 * a signed action descriptor. The descriptor flows to the browser as a
 * `pending_action` SSE event, the user reviews a confirmation card, and on
 * approval the descriptor is posted back to the confirm endpoint which verifies
 * the signature, re-validates, and performs the real write.
 *
 * The descriptor is the integrity boundary: it carries the validated/resolved
 * fields, the owning `userId`, and an `expiresAt`, all covered by the HMAC
 * signature. The confirm endpoint always re-validates and re-checks ownership;
 * the signature only guarantees the client did not tamper with what the
 * assistant proposed.
