/**
 * Reverse-relay control tools. These do not touch the financial dataset -- they
 * route a chat prompt from the Monize web UI to this agent and the answer back
 * -- so both carry the READ_ONLY annotation (the hint describes effect on the
 * user's data, which is none here). The agent does the actual work through the
 * other MCP tools between `get_next_prompt` and `post_response`.
 *
 * Usage pattern the agent is told to follow: loop forever -- call
 * `get_next_prompt`; if `hasPrompt` is false, call it again; otherwise handle
 * the request with the Monize tools, narrating progress with `report_progress`
 * as it goes, then call `post_response` with the final answer, then loop.

          "Long-poll for the next prompt a user typed in the Monize web chat. Returns { hasPrompt: false } if none arrives within the poll window -- in that case call this tool again immediately to keep listening. EXCEPTION: if the result is { hasPrompt: false, stop: true }, the user has been inactive for a while -- STOP your polling loop and exit cleanly; do NOT call get_next_prompt again. The web chat tells the user you disconnected for inactivity, and they reconnect you (re-run your loop) when they want to continue. When hasPrompt is true, handle the request using the other Monize tools, calling report_progress with short status updates as you work (before a lookup, or when sending a confirmation card), then call post_response with promptId and your final answer. ALWAYS finish a claimed prompt and call post_response, even for a long task: never abandon it partway. Send your FIRST report_progress immediately after claiming a prompt, and keep sending one at least every minute or two while you read, plan, or compose a large request -- the web chat shows the user a 'went quiet' message if it hears nothing from you for a few minutes, and a steady progress signal prevents that. 'history' is the prior conversation, oldest first. If 'attachments' is present, the user uploaded files with the prompt: read each attachment's 'uri' (a monize-attachment:// resource) to view the file before answering. Text files are also inlined into the prompt text, so you only need to read image and PDF attachments.",
